    - "FP8 quantization (fits single H100 DGX, minimal quality loss)"
    - "On-the-fly int4 quantization (further memory reduction)"
    - "TensorRT-LLM optimization for NVIDIA infrastructure"
    - "Transformers v4.51.0+ with flex_attention support"
  
  integration_considerations: |
    - Pair with Llama Guard 3 for input/output safety filtering
    - Use Prompt Guard for jailbreak/injection detection
    - Deploy Code Shield if code generation is primary use case
    - System prompts critical for tone and behavior control
    - Requires transformers v4.51.0 or higher
    - FP8 quantization recommended for cost-performance balance
    - 128K context requires ~100GB+ VRAM in BF16, less with quantization
    - Up to 5 images per query validated; beyond this requires custom testing
    - Multi-image processing increases memory and latency requirements
  
  fine_tuning_guidance: |
    - Pre-trained base model available for custom fine-tuning
    - Fine-tune for languages beyond 12 supported (trained on 200+ languages)
    - Custom safety tuning recommended for specific use cases
    - Developers responsible for safety of fine-tuned deployments
    - MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluations recommended
    - Llama Agentic System reference implementation available
    - Community contributions via GitHub encouraged

  data_quality_assessment: |
    COMPLETE DATA:
    - Technical specifications (MoE architecture, 128 experts, 17B active parameters)
    - Comprehensive benchmark scores across text, vision, code, math, multilingual
    - Training methodology (data volume, alignment approach, compute requirements)
    - License terms (Llama 4 Community License with 700M MAU threshold)
    - Multimodal capabilities (text + image input, up to 5 images)
    - 12 officially supported languages + 200 training languages
    - Deployment options (BF16, FP8, int4 quantization)
    - Safety evaluation approach (red teaming, CBRNE, child safety, cyber)
    
    PARTIAL DATA:
    - Training data composition (high-level sources disclosed, details missing)
    - Vision capability boundaries (up to 5 images tested, beyond this unclear)
    - MoE routing behavior and expert specialization patterns
    - Hallucination rates (not quantified)
    - Latency and throughput characteristics (provider-dependent)
    
    CRITICAL GAPS:
    - Detailed training dataset composition and data quality controls
    - Pricing information (varies by provider, no standardized reference)
    - Comprehensive fairness and demographic bias testing
    - Vision-specific failure modes and adversarial robustness
    - MoE routing vulnerabilities and expert manipulation risks
    - Long-term reliability and consistency testing
    - Privacy evaluation (memorization, extraction attacks)
    - Comparative benchmarks against GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0, Claude 3.5
    
    Confidence level: HIGH
    - Core technical specifications extremely well-documented by Meta
    - Benchmark scores comprehensive and validated across multiple domains
    - Training compute and emissions transparently reported
    - Open weights enable third-party validation
    - Multimodal capabilities clearly scoped (text + images, up to 5)
    - License terms unambiguous (700M MAU threshold, commercial use allowed)
    - MoE architecture details disclosed (128 experts, 17B active)
    - Critical gaps primarily in data transparency and fairness evaluation
    
    Recommended additional testing:
    - Domain-specific accuracy evaluation (especially multimodal tasks)
    - Hallucination rate measurement for vision + text reasoning
    - Bias and fairness auditing across demographics and cultures
    - Privacy testing (memorization, data extraction from Meta product data)
    - Adversarial robustness for images (adversarial patches, perturbations)
    - MoE routing analysis and expert specialization patterns
    - Long-context quality degradation at 128K token limit
    - Multi-image reasoning consistency (>5 images if needed)
    - System-level safety validation with Llama Guard 3
